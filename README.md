# FLUTE Pipeline
## Purpose
FLUTE pipeline...
## Basic Overview
1. User imports FLIM images (.sdt), a mask for these images (.tiff), and IRF values (.txt).
2.  Our pipeline masks the images and splits all cells. It also creates a shifted IRF .tif.
3.  User can use these new files for FLUTE visualization.
